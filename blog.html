                    data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.
                    Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created
                    and assigned to that particular tab.

                    <strong>Global scope:</strong> A variable exists inside or outside a block. If a variable is
                    declared outside all functions or curly braces ({}), it exists in the global scope. The global
                    variables can be accessed by any line of code in the program, including inside blocks.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Block scope:</strong> Block scope is that the block statements, don't create a new scope. So
                    the var keyword will not have an effect, because the variables
                    are still in the same scope.

                    A programming structure that continually tests for external events and calls the appropriate
                    routines to handle them. An event loop is often the main loop in a program that typically waits for
                    the user to trigger something.

                    On each iteration, the event loop tries to synchronously pull out the next callback from the queue.
                    If there is no callback to execute at the moment, pop() blocks the main thread. When the callback is
                    ready, the event loop executes it. The execution of a callback always happens synchronously.A

                    undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global scope. The initial
                    value of undefined is the primitive value undefined.

                    In all non-legacy browsers, undefined is a non-configurable, non-writable property.

                    A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also
                    returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A
                    function returns undefined if a value was not returned.
