                <div class="accordion-body"> sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while
                    data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.
                    Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created
                    and assigned to that particular tab.
